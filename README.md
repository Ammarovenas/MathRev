# MathRev
a program to help review math problems from different books.


Add problems: Users can add math problems to the application. Each problem can be associated with a subject and a book. The problem's description can include an image, and a solution is also provided for the problem.

Review problems: Users can start reviewing problems in the application. During the review, a timer is displayed to track the time spent on each problem. Users can reveal the solution to the problem and mark the problem as correct or incorrect. Based on the user's input, the application updates the solved value and the time spent on the problem.

Database management: The application uses SQLAlchemy to manage the database, storing subjects, books, problems, and solutions. The images associated with the problems are also saved and managed within the database.
